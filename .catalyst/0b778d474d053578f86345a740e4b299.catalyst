Two Teams Composing","contestId":"1335","problemIndex":"C","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>You have $$$n$$$ students under your control and you have to compose <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly two teams</span> consisting of some subset of your students.

Firstly, these two teams should have the same size. Two more constraints:</p><p></p><ul> <li> The first team should consist of students with <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">distinct</span> skills (i.e. all skills in the first team are unique). </li><li> The second team should consist of students with <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the same</span> skills (i.e. all skills in the second team are equal). </li></ul><p></p><p>Note that it is permissible that some student of the first team has the same skill as a student of the second team.</p><p>Consider some examples (skills are given):</p><p></p><ul> <li> $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[4, 4]$$$ is not a good pair of teams because sizes should be the same; </li><li> $$$[1, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 3, 3]$$$ is not a good pair of teams because the first team should not contain students with the same skills; </li><li> $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[3, 4, 4]$$$ is not a good pair of teams because the second team should contain students with the same skills; </li><li> $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[3, 3, 3]$$$ is a good pair of teams; </li><li> $$$[5]$$$, $$$[6]$$$ is a good pair of teams. </li></ul><p></p><p>Your task is to find the maximum possible size $$$x$$$ for which it is possible to compose a valid pair of teams, where each team size is $$$x$$$ (skills in the first team needed to be unique, skills in the second team should be the same between them).
